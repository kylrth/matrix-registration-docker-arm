# matrix-registration-docker-arm

[matrix-registration](https://github.com/ZerataX/matrix-registration) is an awesome project that lets you control who signs up for your [Matrix](matrix.org) server using tokens.

This project builds a docker image that hosts the matrix-registration server. You can find the image [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kylrth/matrix-registration). The image was built on ARM, but if you need to run in a different architecture just clone this repository and run `docker build`.
